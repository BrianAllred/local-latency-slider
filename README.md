I took blue-dev's code for the [orginal arena latency slider mod](https://github.com/blu-dev/arena-latency-slider) and modified it so that it only works with local online. You can read the readme on the original repo to get details as to how exactly the mod works.

## Installation

Download liblocal_latency_slider.nro from the release page.
Place it in the corresponding folder. This is how it should look:

Yuzu: %yuzu_folder%/sdmc/atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/skyline/plugins/liblocal_latency_slider.nro

Ryujinx: %ryujinx_folder%/sdcard/atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/skyline/plugins/liblocal_latency_slider.nro

## Usage

When your in the character select screen (for local online), you can press DPAD left/right to adjust the delay.

Ideally you would want to use this on an emulator like yuzu and combine it with the 120 fps mod. This will give you very close to native delay when playing online on LDN.
